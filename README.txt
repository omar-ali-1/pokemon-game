 ---Game Description---
The Pokémon Game engages the user in a Pokémon battle with the computer.

The user is prompted to select one out of three available Pokémon: Balbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Every Pokémon has the following stats: 
- Hit Points (HP) 
- Attack
- Speed
- Defense
There are also functions that can be used to request parts of that information about any Pokémon. 

There are eight total attack types, each affecting a certain stat of the attacked Pokémon. Each Pokémon can use a certain set of four of those attacks.

Throughout a battle, the HP of both Pokémon will be displayed. The Pokémon whose HP reaches zero first will faint and lose the battle. When the attack selected by either the user or the computer is particularly effective, a message will also be printed after the battle round stating so.
